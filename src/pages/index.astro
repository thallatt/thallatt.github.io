I explore how the formation environment of planets in the Galaxy has differed across cosmic time, and how that may manifest in the planet distribution around some of the oldest stars in the Milky Way. <b>This work has been featured in the press!</b>"

    img="/eva.png"
    desc="The abundance of intermediate-sized planets drops at small orbital distances. I showed that this can be explained by these planetsâ€™ propensity to lose their puffy atmospheres closer in to their host stars. The theory predicts that such planets become less common around more massive stars, which has since been confirmed!"

    img="/Disk.jpeg"
    desc="Gas giant planet abundance grows rapidly with orbital period. I showed that this feature can be carved out if giant planets arrive at their final orbital locations via migration through their natal protoplanetary disks. Our theory predicts that the giant planet population grows more toward longer orbital periods."
